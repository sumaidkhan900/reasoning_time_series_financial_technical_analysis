        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a Python implementation of the Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA) framework presented in Koa et al. (2025). The core of this repository is the iPython Notebook `reasoning_time_series_financial_technical_analysis_draft.ipynb`, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions to replicate the paper's findings. The pipeline is designed as a robust and scalable system for generating dual-output stock forecasts that are both numerically accurate and accompanied by a human-readable analytical narrative.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper's central contribution is a novel, multi-stage training methodology that teaches a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform financial technical analysis and fuses its reasoning with a dedicated time-series forecasting model. This codebase operationalizes the paper's experimental design, allowing users to:\n",
        "-   Rigorously validate and manage the entire experimental configuration via a single `config.yaml` file.\n",
        "-   Execute a multi-stage data preparation pipeline to cleanse, window, and annotate time-series data with a full suite of technical indicators.\n",
        "-   Train a reasoning LLM (`πθ`) using a three-stage process: cold-start Reinforcement Learning (RL), Rejection Sampling with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and final performance-tuning RL.\n",
        "-   Train a bespoke, dual-branch time-series backbone (`φ`) using a cross-modal alignment objective.\n",
        "-   Train a conditional fusion model (`ψ`) that learns to guide the backbone's forecast using attributes derived from the LLM's reasoning.\n",
        "-   Run a complete, end-to-end inference pipeline to generate the final dual output (forecast + narrative).\n",
        "-   Train and evaluate strong baseline models (DLinear, TSMixer) under identical conditions for fair comparison.\n",
        "-   Perform a comprehensive evaluation of all models on both statistical error metrics (MSE, MAE) and a realistic portfolio backtest using Markowitz optimization.\n",
        "-   Conduct a full suite of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results to key hyperparameter choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented methods are grounded in principles from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and modern portfolio theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Time-GRPO for Reasoning:**\n",
        "The reasoning LLM is trained using a novel objective called Time-Series Group Relative Policy Optimization (Time-GRPO), a variant of PPO. The policy `πθ` is optimized to maximize a reward signal derived from the accuracy of its generated forecast. The core reward is the inverse Mean Squared Error:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "r_{\\mathrm{MSE}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda \\cdot \\lVert \\hat{y}_\\theta - y \\rVert^2 + \\epsilon}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "The policy is updated using a clipped surrogate objective with a KL penalty to maintain language fluency, based on the group-relative advantage \\( A_i = (r_i - \\mathrm{mean}(\\{r_j\\})) / (\\mathrm{std}(\\{r_j\\}) + \\epsilon) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Cross-Modal Alignment:**\n",
        "The time-series backbone `φ` is trained to align the numerical time-series domain with a latent language space. This is achieved via a cross-attention mechanism where the time-series embeddings `X_time` act as the query and a set of \"language prototypes\" `D` (derived from a base LLM's vocabulary via PCA) act as the key and value.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "X_{\\text{text}} = \\mathrm{Softmax}\\left( \\frac{(X_{\\text{time}} W_Q) (D W_K)^T}{\\sqrt{C}} \\right) (D W_V)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "The model is trained with a dual-loss objective that encourages consistency between the temporal and aligned-textual branches.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Classifier-Free Guidance for Fusion:**\n",
        "The final forecast is a blend of the unconditional prediction from the backbone `ŷ_φ(X)` and a conditional prediction `ŷ_ψ(X, c)` that is guided by attributes `c` from the LLM's reasoning. The fusion model `ψ` is trained with random dropping of the conditioning vector `c`. At inference, two forward passes are performed (one with `c`, one without) and the results are blended:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat{y} = \\hat{y}_\\phi(X) + s \\cdot \\big( \\hat{y}_\\psi(X, c) - \\hat{y}_\\phi(X) \\big)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "where `s` is the guidance scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Markowitz Portfolio Optimization:**\n",
        "To assess financial utility, a daily-rebalanced portfolio is constructed by solving the Markowitz mean-variance optimization problem. The model's multi-step price forecasts are used to derive the expected returns `μ` and the covariance matrix `Σ` of the assets. The optimizer finds the weights `w` that maximize the risk-adjusted return:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\max_{w} \\; \\mu_t^\\top w - \\frac{\\gamma}{2} w^\\top \\Sigma_t w \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad w \\succeq 0, \\; \\mathbf{1}^\\top w = 1\n",

        "-   **Complete Replication and Robustness:** A single top-level function call can execute the entire study, including a comprehensive suite of sensitivity analyses.\n",
        "-   **Full Provenance:** The pipeline generates a unique run directory for each experiment, containing a detailed log file, a copy of the exact configuration used, and all generated artifacts for full reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology Implemented\n",

        "While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts."

        "# Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Professor's Summary: Koa et al., \"Reasoning on Time-Series for Financial Technical Analysis\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **The Core Problem and Research Gap**\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors begin by correctly identifying a significant gap in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to finance. While LLMs like BloombergGPT have proven adept at processing textual data—such as news, sentiment, and financial reports—they have largely neglected the domain of **Technical Analysis**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical Analysis is the art and science of forecasting future price movements based on historical price and volume data. This is a fundamentally different task from text processing. It involves a challenging **domain switch**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Input:** Numerical time-series data (stock prices, volume, etc.).\n",
        "2.  **Process:** Human-like reasoning based on established technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands). This reasoning is expressed in natural language.\n",
        "3.  **Output:** A numerical time-series forecast.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper posits that existing models fail here. Traditional time-series models are often \"black boxes\" that lack interpretability, while direct application of LLMs to numerical forecasting is suboptimal and loses the model's core language capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **The Proposed Solution — Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA)**\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this, the authors introduce a novel framework called **Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA)**. The core idea is to create a hybrid, dual-process system that mimics a human analyst working with a quantitative model. It elegantly separates the task into two components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Verbal Reasoning (\"The Analyst\"):** An LLM is trained to analyze the time-series data and produce an interpretable, natural language reasoning trace that explains its forecast.\n",
        "2.  **Latent Thinking (\"The Quant\"):** A powerful, LLM-based time-series forecasting model generates the actual numerical predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key innovation is not just having these two components, but making them work synergistically. The verbal reasoning from the \"analyst\" is used to guide and improve the numerical output of the \"quant,\" making the final forecast both more accurate and fully explainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **The Methodological Breakdown**\n",
        "\n",
        "The VTA framework is implemented through a sophisticated three-part methodology.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Part A: Teaching the LLM to Reason (Verbal Reasoning)**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is perhaps the most novel part of the paper. How do you teach an LLM to perform technical analysis without a massive dataset of human analysts' thoughts?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Input Annotation:** The raw time-series data (price, volume) is first converted into a textual format the LLM can understand. This involves calculating key statistics (min, max, mean) and a suite of standard **technical indicators** (SMA, EMA, Momentum, etc.). This annotated text serves as the prompt for the LLM.\n",
        "2.  **Reinforcement Learning for Optimization:** The LLM is then fine-tuned using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) objective called **Time-GRPO**. The crucial element here is the **reward function**. Instead of rewarding for stylistic correctness, the model is rewarded based on the **accuracy of the forecast it implies**. Specifically, the reward is the *inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE)*. This brilliantly incentivizes the LLM to generate reasoning that leads to quantitatively accurate predictions.\n",
        "3.  **Multi-Stage Training:** This RL process is conducted in stages (cold-start, rejection sampling, and final optimization) to ensure the model learns effectively and produces high-quality reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Part B: The Backbone Forecasting Model (Latent Thinking)**\n",
        "\n",
        "For the numerical forecasting, the authors employ a state-of-the-art LLM-based time-series model (specifically, one similar to CALF). This model works by aligning the embedding space of the time-series data with the LLM's internal word embedding space. This allows the powerful transformer architecture, originally designed for language, to effectively capture complex temporal patterns in the numerical data. On its own, this model is powerful but not interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Part C: Fusing Reasoning and Forecasting (Joint Conditional Training)**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the final, critical step where the two components are integrated.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Attribute Extraction:** The system takes the verbal reasoning trace generated by the LLM in Part A and extracts key descriptive attributes (e.g., predicted max value, min value, mean value).\n",
        "2.  **Conditional Forecasting:** The numerical forecasting model from Part B is then conditioned on these attributes. In essence, the model is asked to produce a forecast *given that the reasoning trace is true*.\n",
        "3.  **Classifier-Free Guidance:** Drawing inspiration from image generation models, the final forecast is a weighted average of the *conditional* forecast (guided by the reasoning) and an *unconditional* forecast (the model's raw prediction). A \"guidance scale\" parameter controls how much influence the verbal reasoning has on the final output. This joint training preserves both the raw accuracy of the forecasting model and the interpretability from the reasoning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Experimental Validation and Results**\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors conduct a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Forecasting Accuracy:** On several stock market datasets (StockNet, Dow Jones, China A50, etc.), VTA achieves **state-of-the-art performance**, outperforming 14 other models, including traditional time-series transformers and other time-series LLMs. It consistently yields lower MSE and MAE.\n",
        "2.  **Reasoning Quality:** This is a crucial test of their \"interpretability\" claim. They surveyed 25 financial industry experts (from firms like JPMorgan and UBS), who blindly rated the reasoning traces from VTA against those from other powerful LLMs. VTA's outputs were rated significantly higher across all criteria, especially in **Depth, Accuracy, and Relevance**—the metrics most tied to genuine technical expertise.\n",
        "3.  **Practical Utility (Portfolio Optimization):** To demonstrate real-world value, the forecasts from VTA were used to construct **Markowitz-optimized portfolios**. The resulting portfolio achieved the **highest Sharpe Ratio** among all tested models, indicating superior risk-adjusted returns. This is a strong validation from a practical, econometric perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Conclusion and Professor's Critique**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:** The paper successfully demonstrates that a hybrid framework combining verbal reasoning and latent time-series forecasting can achieve superior results in both accuracy and interpretability for financial technical analysis. The Time-GRPO objective with an inverse MSE reward is a clever mechanism for training quantitative reasoning without direct supervision.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Critique and Outlook:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Strengths:** The dual-process \"Analyst + Quant\" paradigm is conceptually elegant and powerful. The methodology is technically sophisticated, particularly the use of a forecast-accuracy-based reward signal in the RL loop and the classifier-free guidance for conditioning. The three-pronged evaluation (accuracy, expert review, portfolio performance) is exceptionally thorough.\n",
        "*   **Potential Limitations:** The model's reasoning is constrained by the initial set of technical indicators provided in the annotation step. It can reason about them, but it cannot invent new ones. Furthermore, the system's performance during unprecedented market events or \"black swans\" remains an open question, as its knowledge is derived from historical patterns.\n",
        "*   **Future Directions:** This work opens up exciting avenues. The framework could be extended to incorporate multi-modal data, such as news text and sentiment, into the reasoning process. It could also be applied to other domains where numerical data requires interpretable reasoning, such as medical chart analysis or economic forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Koa et al. have produced a first-rate piece of research that represents a significant step towards creating true hybrid intelligence in quantitative finance—systems that not only predict accurately but can also explain *why* they are making those predictions in a manner that a human expert can trust and verify."
